# Blind Dating App

## Problem Statement

Traditional dating apps often focus on superficial elements, leading to fleeting connections and user dissatisfaction. This project addresses the need for deeper compatibility matching, aiming for meaningful, long-term connections rather than quick, superficial swipes.

## Solution Overview

The Blind Dating App introduces a unique "dating club" model tailored for university students, promoting a safer, more meaningful matchmaking process. Key features include:

- **Preference-Based Matching:** Matches are made based on shared interests and values, not just physical appearance.
- **Gamified Interactions:** Engaging users through games that reveal preferences and personalities.
- **Secure Messaging:** Ensuring private and secure communication between matches.
- **Membership System:** A small fee for joining the club, fostering a committed user base and funding app maintenance.

## Unique Value Proposition

Unlike conventional dating apps, our focus is on building long-term connections through a blind dating approach. By prioritizing compatibility and secure, meaningful interaction, we offer a refreshing alternative to the swipe fatigue of traditional dating platforms.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend:** Convex for managing backend services efficiently.
- **Other:** Machine Learning algorithms for enhancing the matching process (TBD).

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blind-dating-app.git
```

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### Configure Convex (see project documentation for detailed setup)

### Run the development server
```
npm start
```


## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key folders:

- `components/`: Reusable components used throughout the app.
- `screens/`: Individual screens of the app, e.g., profile setup, messaging.
-`convex/`: Convex models and functions for backend logic.

## MVP Features
Completed features for the MVP include:
- User profiles with comprehensive preference inputs.
- A basic matching mechanism to initiate connections.
- Secure in-app messaging for private communication between matches.

Partially implemented features:
- Membership system and payment processing (TBD).

## Future Roadmap
- Robust Matching Algorithm: Implementing a sophisticated ML-powered compatibility scoring system.
= Gamification Expansion: Introducing more interactive elements to enrich the user experience.
- Payment Gateway Integration: Streamlining membership fees and in-app purchases.
- Polished UI/UX: Enhancing the visual and navigational aspects of the app.
- Expanded Verification System: Ensuring a safe and trustworthy user environment.
